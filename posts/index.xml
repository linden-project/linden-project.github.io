Yesterday I ported the Lindex indexer to Hugo. I will call this new indexer Carl, named after Carolus Linnaeus.
Today I started reorganizing all documentation and this is the new first Blog post in the also new Linden Project Website, which you obviously managed to find as you&amp;rsquo;re reading it right now.
More interesting things will come soon.</description></item></channel></rss>
