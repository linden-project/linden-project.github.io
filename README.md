# linden-project.github.io

The Linden Project is a front matter inspired personal wiki or notes database specification and ecosystem. Currently there is the [Linden Specification](https://github.com/linden-project/linden-spec), a [Vim client](https://github.com/mipmip/linny.vim), two indexer implementations and some utlities.

Linden is intended for personal use and currently is a personal project too. I welcome people to join me in designing and creating tools for having our extra brains.
