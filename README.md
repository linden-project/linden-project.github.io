# linden-project.github.io

The Linden Project is a front matter inspired personal wiki or notes database specification and ecosystem. Currently there is the Linden Specification, a Vim client, two indexer implementations and some utlities.

Linden is intended for personal use and currently is a personal project too. I welcome people to join me in designing and creating tools for having our extra brains.
