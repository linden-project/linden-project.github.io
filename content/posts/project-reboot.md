After begin quiet for more then two years, I'm rebooting the Linden Project.
Yesterday I ported the Lindex indexer to Hugo. I will call this new indexer
*Carl*, named after Carolus Linnaeus.

Today I started reorganizing all documentation and this is the new first Blog
post in the also new Linden Project Website, which you obviously managed to
find as you're reading it right now.

More interesting things will come soon. *Carl* will be released soon. Currently
I generates json index files to be used by the Linny Editor in Vim. Of course
as Hugo is an website generator, this is a big invitation to create a front end
for the Linny Database.

This website will serve as home base for the Linden Specification. The Hugo
port needed us to change some of the designs of the index files, so we will
implement these in the specification.

For the time being, will also serve as documentation home for
[Linny.vim](https://github.com/linden-project/linny.vim),
[Lindex](https://github.com/linden-project/lindex) and
[Fred](https://github.com/linden-project/fred). All these projects are now
officially member of the Linden Project.
