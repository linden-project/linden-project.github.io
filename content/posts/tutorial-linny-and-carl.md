# Introduction

This is a short tutorial to get you started with Linny.vim and Carl. Linny.vim
is a Personal Wiki and Document database inside Vim. It helps you organize all
your markdown files using a smart navigation menu that is configured with
yaml and which reads index files.

The index files contain useful summaries generated by an indexer. We
need the indexer to maintain speed. In theory Vim could do the same but this
would kill all performance. We will setup Carl to create the index files.

## Requirements

For this tutorial you need up to date versions of Vim and Hugo. This tutorial
is for Mac, Linux and BSD users. Sorry Windows people.

You need to have basic Vim knowledge and know how to install plugins.

# Setup Carl

To install and run Carl you must clone the git repo. Run the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/linden-project/carl ~/MyWiki
cd ~/MyWiki
```

The configuration of Carl is located at `config/_default/config.yaml`. Most
settings need to be kept, but the settings below can be modified to your needs.

```yaml
contentDir: wikiContent
dataDir: wikiConfig
publishDir: wikiIndex

taxonomies:
  tag: "tags"
  project: "projects"
  customer: "customers"
```

## Run the carl indexer

We will use the default Carl configuration for now. So lets start the engines...

Open a new terminal and run the command below.

```bash
hugo server \
  --renderToDisk \
  --ignoreCache \
  --forceSyncStatic \
  --cleanDestinationDir \
  --disableFastRender
```

The above command tell's hugo to start as server daemon, but to write every
change to the configured directories.

# Setup Linny.vim

We can now install and configure linny.vim in vim. I use `junegunn/vim-plug`. To install linny.vim, add

```vim
Plug 'linden-project/linny.vim'
```

And afterward run `PlugInstall`. Ignore the error messages.

## Configure the Wiki paths

We have to tell Linny.vim where the markdown files are stored and where the
index is located. Finally we ask linny to initialize.

Add below to your `vimrc`

```vim
let g:linnycfg_path_wiki_content     = $HOME . '/MyWiki/wikiContent'
let g:linnycfg_path_wiki_config      = $HOME . '/MyWiki/wikiConfig'
let g:linnycfg_path_index            = $HOME . '/MyWiki/wikiIndex'

call linny#Init()
```

Restart Vim to be sure everything is loaded correctly. Fire up the Linny menu to check if everything is working.

```
:LinnyMenuOpen
```

Press 1 afterwards.

# First Steps in Linny.vim

When you see the menu on the left side everything worked as it should. It should look like this:

![](/linny-firstview.png)

With the menu open you can use the cursor to navigate. You can also use the
number and letter keys listed before the menu items.

## Adding documents

Inside a document you can add a wiki link between two square brackets. E.g.

```markdown
This is a link to [[My first document]].
```


Afterwards move your cursor above the link and click enter. A new document will
be created.

Another way of creating a document is browsing to a term. E.g. Tags -> Note.
When you're located in the term menu, you can click ````A````. You'll be asked
to enter a new name and it will be created with the term ````tags: note```` in
the Front Matter.

The last method to create a new document is to execute the ex-command ````:LinnyNewDoc````

You can allways press ````R```` to refresh the Linny.vim menu.

NOTE: Sometime the index files are not updated automatically. Restart the hugo
process to fix this problem. This behaviour should be fixed soon.

## Configure views

There are three types of menu views:

- root view and custom views
- taxonomy views
- term views

The root view is the opened when the Linny menu is opened for first time. You
can always go back to the root by clicking ````0```` inside the menu window.
You can edit this view clicking "Edit this view" at the bottom of the menu. It
looks like this:

```yaml
---
widgets:

  - title: Starred Documents
    type: starred_documents
    hidden: false

  - title: Starred Terms
    type: starred_terms
    hidden: false

  - title: Starred Taxanomies
    type: starred_taxonomies

  - hidden: false
    title: Extra Menu
    type: menu
    items:
      - title: Open 'Tags'
        execute: call linny_menu#openterm('tags', '')
      - title: Open 'Tags:Note'
        execute: call linny_menu#openterm('tags', 'note')
      - title: Open View 'all'
        execute: call linny_menu#openview('all')
```

You can change the order, the titles, and also add more menu items. Checkout
wikiConfig/views/all.yml for all available view components.

## Changing Taxonomies.

You can modify your taxonomies in `config/_default/config.yaml`, Restart your
Hugo process afterwards. The taxonomy should now be listed in the Linny.vim
menu all_taxonomies.
