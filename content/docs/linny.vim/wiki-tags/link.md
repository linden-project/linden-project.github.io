# Wiki-link-tag

By using wiki-link-tags you point to another linden-document in the wiki
database. When the document does not exist it will be created and opened afterwards.

Internal wiki links are created by surrounding one or more words between double
square brackets.

E.g. ````[[Project Linny]]```` becomes ````content/wiki/project-linny.md````
