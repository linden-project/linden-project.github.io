The Linden Project is a front matter inspired personal wiki specification and
ecosystem. Currently there is the Linden Specification, a Vim
client, two indexer implementations and some utlities.

Linden is intended for personal use and currently is a personal project too. I
welcome people to join me in designing and creating tools for having our extra
brains.
